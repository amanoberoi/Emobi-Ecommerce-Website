Pan-Asian/GlobalCritic's Pick: Pogaro 
"268 Augusta, at College, 416-840-0501. With culinary roots that link it to the Queen Mother, Rivoli, Lava and and Tom “Foxley” Thai’s Tempo, it’s no surprise that the East-meets-West fare dished up at this Kensington Market resto lounge is so accomplished. And did we mention cheap? The house’s spectacular all-day four-course prix fixe goes for all of $15. Make sure to have a coupla drinks and tip five bucks more than your usual 15 per cent. Best: chef Manh Nguyen’s substantial meal deals start with soup – a rustic lamb meatball soup sided with a wedge of house-baked focaccia, perhaps – then continue with ripe mango salad, skewers of turmeric-tinged chicken satay, and quite possibly the best vegetarian pad thai in the city, before finishing with banana spring rolls dipped in chocolate sauce. Open daily 5pm to 11 pm; bar nightly to 2 am. Closed some holidays. Licensed. Access: three steps at door, washrooms on same floor. Rating: NNNNN critic's pick"

Our dinner menu’s flavours and spices are based in Asian fusion cuisine, tapas style for sharing with friends but many additional “market fresh” items from our local “Kensington Market” are also represented in unique daily specials, so just check out the menu online!  The late night post-dinner “programming menu” at Supermarket is eclectic. Saturday's feature Do Right Saturday Night at Supermarket with  DJ’s Fase, John Kong, Circle Research and MC Abdominal.  On Fridays, we always have a great vibe going with different “monthly” parties such as The Movement Collective, Soul Power, Rollin’ & Scratchin, etc. – just check out the calendar. During the week all kinds of other events such as comedy, visuals, book launches and readings, community fundraisers, songwriter and acoustic nights, indie bands and much more! Again just refer to the calendar.
